# Snoogens Arena Marksman Hunter v1.3  
![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/hkIYw42.png)  

A PVP only rotation with a specific focus on Arena, however with full support for Battleground usage.  
Supports any level.  
Only compatible with English Language World of Warcraft Client. This means that this rotation won't work for WoW clients with German, Russian etc languages.  
Purchase a license through https://shoppy.gg/@snoogens  
Discord: https://discord.gg/VksJWWk9PS  
Unzip and place the `Snoogens-Arena-Marksman-Hunter` folder under your Aimsharp Rotations folder, e.g. `X:\AimsharpFolder\Bin\Rotations`  
Place the `license.txt` file you've recieved by email after purchasing in the `Snoogens-Arena-Marksman-Hunter` folder.  

I recommend using this rotation together with Aimsharp's ArenaPVP Kicks plugin.

• You're playing 3v3, wouldn't it be nice if that Healer ended up as your focus target? Once again, look no further!  

**Immunity Checks!**

**Scatter Shot Convoke!**  
• Druid about to slam you and your team to the ground with a Convoke? Countershot isnt ready, or maybe they are immune to interrupts? BAM - Scatter Shot!  

**Scatter Shot Focus while Bursting!**  
• Don't want to think about CCing with Scatter while Bursting? No worries, I got it under control - I'll even make sure to not overlap with any other CC.  

**Feign Death when Low!**
• Last ditch effort to survive, Feign Death when you're low automatically! Works great when using Survival Tactics.
