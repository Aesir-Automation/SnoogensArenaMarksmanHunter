# Snoogens Arena Marksman Hunter v1.0  
![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/nbkVBnF.png)  

A PVP only rotation with a specific focus on Arena, however with full support for Battleground usage.  
Purchase a license through https://shoppy.gg/@snoogens  
Unzip and place the `Snoogens-Arena-Marksman-Hunter` folder under your Aimsharp Rotations folder, e.g. `X:\AimsharpFolder\Bin\Rotations`  
Place the `license.txt` file you've recieved by email after purchasing in the `Snoogens-Arena-Marksman-Hunter` folder.  

I recommend using this rotation together with Aimsharp's ArenaPVP Kicks plugin.
